# Chalaxata-rs

Basically a useful tool for creating Chasaf style microtonal notes and stuff.
Eventually aims to create a simple piano roll to edit notes and visually represent them, and get the most accurate MIDI you can get.

# Usage

Currently when you run:
Enter a harmonym (like Chyli) and it'll analyze it for you. for now.

# How to run

get cargo and git installed on your system

run `git pull https://github.com/shuntia/chalaxata-rs;cd chalaxata-rs;cargo run`

That's it for now.
